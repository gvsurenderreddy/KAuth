This was installed on a server running Ubuntu 10.04. It should work on any machine as long as it is running a webserver and PHP (5+).
If you are using the ldap_ad extension you will need php-ldap.

Simply copy the PHPAuth folder to your web directory and edit auth/options for authentication options.
There is a simple interface for testing logins included. Just visit your website with the correct directory.

#          Usage          #
###########################

This distribution attempts to be a set of extensible, modular libraries that authenticate users.
authlib.php is the main library that an array of types and options. It then calls a library for each of the types.
Libraries take the form of auth_libraryname.php. The library must contain a function named libraryname_auth that takes the variables $username, $password, and $options.
Each library must return an array with key "Login" that has a value of "Fail","Server","Restricted","True", or "None". They may also return data with key "data" and an array of key/value pairs and flags with key "flags" and an array of values.
Example:
{"Login":"True","data":{"timeLeft":598},"flags":["noPassword"]}
A key of "errorCode" may be returned if "Login" is "Fail","Server", or "Restricted".
Example:
{"Login":"Server","errorCode":"ldap_ad_3","flags":[]}

This distribution contains an example login handler (login.php), a set of all options available (options.php) and a simple web interface for testing purposes.

Included libraries are:
ldap_ad (Active Directory), al (Access List - JSON encoded file with usernames), dl(Deny List - JSON encoded file with usernames), password_file (JSON encoded file with username / password hash), session (Use PHP sessions to only allow login session), and admincheck (returns an admin flag if administrator is username.)
